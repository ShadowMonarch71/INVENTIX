# Inventix AI
## Evidence-Locked Research & Patent Intelligence Platform

**Performance-first. Evidence-grounded. Legally conservative by design.**

Inventix AI is an advanced **research intelligence and patent novelty analysis system** that combines deterministic algorithms, Small Language Models (SLMs), and evidence-locked reasoning to assist researchers, innovators, and R&D teams across the **entire innovation lifecycle** — from idea conception to publication and patent filing.

Inventix does **not** determine patentability.  
Inventix does **not** replace attorneys, reviewers, or examiners.  
Inventix exists to **augment human judgment with verifiable intelligence**.

## Vision

Inventix AI is designed as a **full-stack intelligence system**, not a single AI feature.

It unifies:
- Research intelligence
- Patent risk analysis
- Knowledge graph reasoning
- Visual analytics
- Workflow orchestration

into a single, coherent platform.

---

## Core Problem

Innovation today is slowed by:
- Fragmented research tools
- Manual prior-art searches
- Unclear novelty signals
- AI hallucinations
- Lack of end-to-end visibility from idea to publication

Inventix treats **uncertainty as a first-class signal**, not something to hide.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Evidence Before Generation**
2. **Performance Over Model Size**
3. **Determinism Wherever Possible**
4. **Explicit Uncertainty ("UNKNOWN")**
5. **Legal & Academic Defensibility**
6. **Visual First-Principles Thinking**

> The model is never trusted. The pipeline is.

## Model Strategy (SLM-First)

Inventix primarily uses **Small Language Models (7B–13B)** for:
- Structured summarization
- Comparative analysis
- Claim scaffolding
- Research synthesis

Large LLMs are optional escalation tools for high-level synthesis only.

Benefits:
- Faster inference
- Lower cost
- Reduced hallucination surface
- Reproducible outputs

## PATENT INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

### Features

- **Patent Novelty Scanner**  
  Detects semantic overlap between ideas and existing patents.

- **Claim Similarity Analyzer**  
  Clause-level comparison against prior claims.

- **Risk Probability Meters**  
  Visual risk scoring for novelty, scope, and overlap.

- **Prior-Art Similarity Radar**  
  Radar charts visualizing overlap intensity across domains.

- **Claim Optimization Suggestions**  
  Evidence-grounded suggestions for scope refinement (conceptual only).

- **Legal Compliance Checker**  
  Flags risky phrasing and non-compliant claim structures.

- **Filing Workflow Pipeline (Animated)**  
  Visual step-by-step patent preparation flow.

## ANALYTICS & INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD

### Research & Innovation Analytics

- Research productivity analytics
- Novelty evolution over time
- Patent success probability (historical pattern-based)
- Conference acceptance prediction
- Publication readiness meter
- Innovation maturity index

All analytics are **probabilistic indicators**, not guarantees.

## Legal & Ethical Boundaries

- Not legal advice
- No patentability claims
- No enforceable claims generated
- Human review required
- Immutable audit logs

---

## What Inventix Is Not

- A patent attorney
- A decision oracle
- A black-box AI
- A free-form chatbot

Inventix AI treats artificial intelligence as a **constrained, visual, and accountable intelligence system** — built to amplify human insight, not replace it.
